# Creating a sponsorship prospectus

This guide and template are designed to help organizers for open source communities communicate their needs to sponsors through a _prospectus_.

A _sponsorship prospectus_ is a structured overview of how your organizations accepts sponsorships and a general outline setting expectations of what that relationship entails.

This document may be a super fancy PDF generated with lots of imagery or a shared document w/ basic text and lists. When in doubt, choose clarity and efficiency in your presentation.

Generally, a _sponsorship prospectus_ should answer the following questions:

* Who is asking for money (organization, non-profit, foundation, etc)
  * What kind of tax structure is this organization in relation to sponsors?
* What does this fund do / what is this for?
* What are the options/levels of funding available to choose from (funding choices w/ basic budgets outlined)
* What does each option/level enable for the organization?
* What does each option/level provide as sponsorship benefits?
* Who does this serve (open source communities, projects, etc)?
* What open source software (project, portfolio, foundation) benefits from this sponsorship?
* Is there a Code of Conduct in place for this (organization, community, event)?
