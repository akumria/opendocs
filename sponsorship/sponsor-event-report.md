# Creating an event report

This guide and template are designed to help organizers for open source communities communicate the impact of their community event through an _event report_.

An _event report_ is a structured overview of how your organization was able to use sponsorships to effectively meet the goals of your community event.

Not all events are the same size or serve the same purpose. An event formed to bring a group of people together to create a sense of belonging and connection is important in and of itself. Not all events should be explained using a return on investment model.

Generally, an _event report_ should answer the following information:

* Name of the sponsored organization (organization, non-profit, foundation, etc)
  * Who does this serve (open source communities, projects, etc)?
  * What open source software (project, portfolio, foundation) benefits from this sponsorship?
* Event details
  * Event name
  * Date
  * Location + format (i.e. virtual/hybrid/in-person)
  * Event website
* Event metrics
  * Number of attendees
  * Number of registrants 
  * Is there a Code of Conduct in place for this (organization, community, event)?
  * Notable metrics (# of speakers, workshops, etc)
* Sponsorship Impact
  * List of benefits activated (from sponsorship contract/prospectus)
  * What did this sponsorship enable for your community?
