# Creating an annual feedback report

This guide and template are designed to help organizers for open source communities communicate the impact of their work with a community through an _annual feedback report_.

An _annual feedback report_ is a structured overview of how your organization was able to use sponsorships to effectively meet the goals as stated in your sponsorship agreement and as they have changed since that agreement was made.

The goal of this report is to make it easier for your sponsors to know what you did and what you plan to do next. You are streamlining the process and conversations around "Was this valuable to us?" in both directions, as well as enabling your organization to ask better questions to sponsors of what is important to them.

Generally, an _annual feedback report_ should answer the following questions:

* Organization information
* Organization point of contact
* What did this sponsorship enable?
* Who did this support?
* Have there been any shifts in your organization in the last year?
* What highlights do you want to showcase?
* What new challenges are you concerned about?
